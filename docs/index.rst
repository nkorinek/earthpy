EarthPy: A Python Package for Earth Data
========================================

`EarthPy` is a python package that makes it easier to plot and work with spatial
raster and vector data using open source tools. Earthpy depends upon `geopandas`
which has a focus on vector data and `rasterio` with facilitates input and
output of raster data files. It also requires `matplotlib` for plotting operations.

EarthPy's goal is to make working with spatial data easier for scientists.
Contributions to `EarthPy` are welcome.
